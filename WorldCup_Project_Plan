# GiumaRamadan.github.io     WorldCup Project
I used this opportunity to increase my football knowledge by doing it in a fun 
exploratory way using SQL to explore and manipulate data to answer some questions I was curious about.
I then wanted to display it as a dashboard to show my friends, the data I found in a cool but easily understandable way.

SQL: 

use fifa_worldcup;

--- Ordering Countries based on numb of Wc they have

SELECT distinct Champion , count(champion) AS Numb_Of_WC 
FROM fifa_worldcup_summary
Group by champion
order by count(champion) DESC;

--- Ordering Countries based on who hosted it the most?

SELECT DISTINCT Host , COUNT(HOST) AS Hosted_Count
FROM fifa_worldcup_summary 
Group by Host
Order by Hosted_count DESC;

--- Total number of WC matches Ever played And goals scored
SELECT SUM(MATCHES_PLAYED)  Total_MatchesPlayed , SUM(Goals_scored)  Total_Goals_Scored FROM FIFA_WORLDCUP_SUMMARY;

--- Ordering Champions based on who scored more goals
SELECT champion , SUM(Goals_Scored) AS Total_goals_scored FROM fifa_worldcup_summary
Group by champion
Order by SUM(goals_scored) DESC;

--- What are the min, max and total AVERAGE  for average goals scored in wc history?
SELECT  MIN(AVG_GOALS_PER_GAME)  , MAX(AVG_GOALS_PER_GAME) , AVG(AVG_GOALS_PER_GAME) 
From fifa_worldcup_Summary;

--- How many times was Argentina a Runner up or third place?
SELECT runner_up , third_place,count(*) FROM fifa_worldcup_summary 
WHERE Runner_up = 'Argentina' or third_place = 'Argentina'
group by runner_up , third_place ;

--- First-ever worldcup Vs Most recent worldcup teams and their respective positions
SELECT F2022.Position, F2022.Team  2022_Teams, 
       F1930.Position, F1930.Team 1930_Teams
FROM fifa_worldcup.fifa1930 F1930
RIGHT JOIN fifa_worldcup.fifa2022 F2022
on F1930.Position = F2022.Position;
